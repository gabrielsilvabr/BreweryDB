The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-, nutmeg-like, mildly smoke-like or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters should be present at low to medium-high levels. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent or present at very low levels. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.",

Little hop bitterness permeates the beer and it possesses a moderate level of alcohol.  The “Hefe” prefix means “with yeast”, hence the beers unfiltered and cloudy appearance.

Baltika Munich will give a new facets taste of juicy meat dishes. Packing of Baltika Munich has classical German-style: inscription Munich Gothic type on the background of all shades of gold, wheat and amber - all this even before the first drink creates the feeling of the typical taste of the German Weiss beer.",

             "description": "Bayliner Weisse is our take on the traditional German Berliner Weisse style.\r\n\r\nHere at GSB, we are all fans of sour beers so naturally we've been eager to brew one of our own. Bayliner Weisse is our take on the traditional German Berliner Weisse style. Over 700 breweries in Germany used to make this beer and by the 19th century it was their most popular style of beer. By the late 20th century only two breweries in Berlin still produce these beers. This particular style is an unfiltered, sour wheat beer that comes in at about 3.6% alc/vol. It is a nice sessionable beer that can be enjoyed anytime of the year. Traditionally served with woodruff or raspberry syrup but it is most enjoyable when served on it's own.",
